#+TITLE: Rhythmbox Controller for Emacs
#+AUTHOR: AmirrezaAsk
* Intro
Concept of the package is borrowed from =helm= and =ivy= controllers for Rhythmbox but rewritten to use Emacs internal =completing-read= function.
Allows you to controll Rhythmbox inside Emacs.
* Installation
Currently the only way is to download and put the file in your =load-path= or use something like =straight.el= or =Qelpa=.
